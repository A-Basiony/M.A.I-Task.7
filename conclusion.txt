by decreasing the sampling rate to 0.25s it captures more data when compared to the 1s it missed small fine details and will result in under presentation of the signal graph.
number of quantization levels affect the accuracy of the amplitude presentation, so the 3 bit quantization presents more accurate amplitude than the 2 bit quantization which will result in more amplitude error.
